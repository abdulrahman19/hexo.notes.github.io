Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
My name is [Abdulrahman Asaad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdulrahmanasaad/), I'm a software engineer with over a decade of experience, a husband, and a proud father. Since 2014, I've been deep in the world of code, solving problems, and constantly learning new things.

I love summarizing what I read and learn, mostly to keep track of my own thoughtsâ€”but if it helps others along the way, even better! That said, Iâ€™m not a writer, just someone who enjoys sharing ideas.

This blog? Well, it's not the most polished or super organized. You might find some quirks, and itâ€™s definitely not the best experience on mobile (sorry about that!). But if you're here, I hope you find something interesting.

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ˜ƒâœ¨
